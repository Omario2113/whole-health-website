        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We believe, that every single person has been through a hard time at one point or another in
            their life, and always found it very hard to talk to other's about whatever it is they are going
            through.
            From homelessness, break-ups, where you just have no direction or will, all the way to serious thoughts
            about
            harming yourself
            or others. We are here for you. We want to help you find the resources you deserve and connect you to
            people who actually
            care. Instead of bottling it up inside or complaints falling on deaf ears.
            <br>
            By signing up and making a profile with
            us, we ensure that all your personal information is kept confidental, while still allowing you to
            connect
            with other's from all around the world, who, either have the need to connect with someone for support
            that has no other way of doing so, or maybe someone who has been in your exact position
            before, and just may hold the key that will give you the ability to get through this. Never do it on
            your
            own. People support
            people.
            Especially in a time of need. Time and time again, we have seen how people have stepped up and come
            together for others in
            major points of
            disasters and heartache.
            Whatever reason you have to hold all of this bottled
            up inside, now you have no excuse any longer. We will never judge you.
            Here at Blahblah, we take pride in making sure that you have all the freedom to talk about whatever it
            is
            that is bothering you whenever you need to.
        </p>
        <p> Blahblah, Go talk about it!</p>
        <p>We Encourage It!!</p>
